    Welcome to my personal website. I am <b> Leverhulme Trust and Isaac Newton Trust Early Career Fellow </b>

    <b> My research applies GeoAI, GIS, big data, and causal inference methods to understand the causes and consequences of spatial inequality, 
    as well as how new technologies and regional development strategies shape spatial inequality </b>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I am the <a href="https://www.regionalstudies.org/news/2025-rsa-annual-conference-plenary/#!">Early Career Plenary Speaker </a> 
    at the opening session of the 2025 Regional Studies Association Annual Conference, and I have also been invited to present my research findings 
    at the Human Development Report Office of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), among other distinguished institutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    I received my Ph.D. in Land Economy from the University of Cambridge with no corrections,
    M.Sc. in Development Economics from Birmingham University with Distinction, 
    and B.A. in Information Management and Information Systems from Renmin University of China. 
    I have done occasional research for the <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/international-inequalities"> International Inequalities Institute </a> 
    and the <a href= "https://www.lse.ac.uk/geography-and-environment"> Department of Geography and Environment </a> at the London School of Economics,

    and Peking University’s <a href="https://www.nse.pku.edu.cn/en/">Institute of New Structural Economics</a>. 
    Outside of academia, I have provided consulting services for international organizations 
    including the OECD and the Asian Development Bank. 
  </p>
  <p>
  I was raised by my elderly grandparents in a small rural village in southeastern China before being selected 
  into a prestigious senior high school in the city. This early experience helps me get the start understanding of spatial inequality.
