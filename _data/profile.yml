    Welcome to my personal website. I am Leverhulme Trust and Isaac Newton Trust Early Career Fellow 
    at the <a href="https://www.landecon.cam.ac.uk/person/zhiwu-wei">Department of Land Economy</a>, 
    and Governing Body Fellow of <a href="https://www.hughes.cam.ac.uk/about/our-people/seniors-members/dr-zhiwu-wei/">Hughes Hall</a>, 
    University of Cambridge. I am also a Visiting Fellow at the Department of Social Policy and Intervention, 
    University of Oxford, and affiliated with Cambridge’s <a href="https://www.landecon.cam.ac.uk/lab-interdisciplinary-spatial-analysis">Lab of Interdisciplinary Spatial Analysis</a>. 
    My research applies GeoAI, GIS, big data, and causal inference methods to understand the causes and consequences of spatial inequality, 
    as well as how new technologies and regional development strategies shape spatial inequality. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I received my Ph.D. in Land Economy from the University of Cambridge with no corrections,
    M.Sc. in Development Economics from Birmingham University with Distinction, 
    and B.A. in Information Management and Information Systems from Renmin University of China. 
    I have done occasional research for the International Inequalities Institute and the Department of Geography and Environment 
    at the London School of Economics, the Cambridge Judge Business School, 
    Tsinghua University’s Institute for China Sustainable Urbanization, 
    and Peking University’s Institute of New Structural Economics. 
    Outside of academia, I have worked and provided consulting services for international organizations 
    including the OECD and the Asian Development Bank.
  </p>
  <p>
  I was raised by my elderly grandparents in a small rural village in southeastern China before being selected 
  into a prestigious senior high school in the city. This early experience helps me get the start understanding of spatial inequality.
