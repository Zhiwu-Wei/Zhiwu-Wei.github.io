    Welcome to my personal website. I am <b> Leverhulme Trust and Isaac Newton Trust Early Career Fellow </b>
    at the <a href="https://www.landecon.cam.ac.uk/person/zhiwu-wei">Department of Land Economy</a>, 
    and Governing Body Fellow of <a href="https://www.hughes.cam.ac.uk/about/our-people/seniors-members/dr-zhiwu-wei/">Hughes Hall</a>, 
    University of Cambridge. I am also a Visiting Fellow at the <a href="https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk">Department of Social Policy and Intervention</a>, 
    University of Oxford, and affiliated with Cambridge’s <a href="https://www.landecon.cam.ac.uk/lab-interdisciplinary-spatial-analysis">
    Lab of Interdisciplinary Spatial Analysis</a>.  
  </p>
  <p>
    My research applies <b>GeoAI, GIS, big data, and causal inference methods </b> to understand the 
    <b>causes and consequences of spatial inequality</b>. Adopting a <b>global comparative perspective</b> that 
    examines regions across both the <b>Global North and South</b>, my work seeks to provide a more holistic understanding of 
    <b>localization within globalization</b>, and to explore ways to promote more <b>inclusive and sustainable development</b> 
    through better multi-level governance. The work spans <b>multiple disciplines</b>, as I believe that the originality and novel disciplines
    of the future will emerge from the mix of diverse fields today.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am the sole <a href="https://www.regionalstudies.org/news/2025-rsa-annual-conference-plenary/#!">Early Career Plenary Speaker </a> 
    at the opening session of the 2025 Regional Studies Association Annual Conference, and I have also been invited to present my research findings 
    at the <a href="https://hdr.undp.org"> Human Development Report Office </a> of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), among other distinguished institutions.
    I have provided consulting services for international organizations such as the OECD and the Asian Development Bank, 
    and my research has been featured and cited in their flagship reports. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I received my Ph.D. in Land Economy from the University of Cambridge with no corrections,
    M.Sc. in Development Economics from Birmingham University with Distinction, 
    and B.A. in Information Management and Information Systems from Renmin University of China. 
    I have done occasional research for the <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/international-inequalities">International Inequalities Institute</a> 
    and the <a href= "https://www.lse.ac.uk/geography-and-environment">Department of Geography and Environment</a> at the London School of Economics, 
    the Cambridge <a href="https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk">Judge Business School</a>, 
    Tsinghua University’s <a href="https://tucsu.tsinghua.edu.cn">Institute for China Sustainable Urbanization</a>, 
    and Peking University’s <a href="https://www.nse.pku.edu.cn/en/">Institute of New Structural Economics</a>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I was raised by my elderly, amiable, and illiterate grandparents in a small rural village in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujian">southeastern China</a>, 
    where I attended local primary and junior high schools before being selected to a prestigious senior high school in the city. 
    This early experience helps me get the start understanding of spatial inequality.
    As an economic geographer, I sincerely hope that through collective efforts across academia and policymaking, we can build a more geographically equitable world 
    where individuals, regardless of their origins, have equal access to opportunities and can share in the benefits of socioeconomic prosperity.
