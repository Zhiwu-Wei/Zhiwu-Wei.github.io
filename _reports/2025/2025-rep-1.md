  The rapid spread of mobile internet has had profound economic and social consequences. In
this context, understanding how policymakers can improve the economic impact of internet
access is an important exercise.
In this paper, we seek to understand the conditions under which mobile internet access impacts
household wealth in the Philippines. In doing so, we examine factors including the urban/rural
divide and the role of education in realizing the returns from better internet connectivity.
We adopt an instrumental variable approach using distance to submarine cable landing points
as an instrument for mobile internet access. Additionally, we exploit the staggered rollout of 0.27
million geocoded cell towers across the Philippines.
Our findings show that mobile internet access significantly increases household wealth,
particularly in rural areas and among less-educated households. However, proximity to cell
towers appears important for internet quality, with diminished connectivity in regions farther
from submarine cable landing points, which may exacerbate regional disparities. Additionally,
while internet access boosts employment opportunities for secondary earners, it does not
significantly impact overall female employment, which may result from structural barriers.
These results suggest the need for policymakers to expand mobile internet coverage in
underserved areas and to complement these investments with initiatives to improve internet
quality, digital literacy, and access to educational resources. Addressing structural barriers,
particularly for women and lower-income households, may also be important for ensuring
equitable economic development through internet access.
