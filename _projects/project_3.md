abstract: >-
  Urban-rural polarisation of values is a key societal cleavage of our time. However, there is still debate about whether the differences observed across places are contextual or purely compositional. We provide novel causal evidence showing that exposure to urban density influences individual outlooks beyond compositional effects, but this influence is primarily driven by the environments where individuals spend their early years. We do this by using household panel data from both the UK and Switzerland, which allows us to combine Two-Stage-Least Squares and ‘Movers’ research designs. We show with two different approaches that exposure to urban density before age 20 causally increases support for immigration and gender equality, highlighting the lasting influence of exposure to urban density early in life.
