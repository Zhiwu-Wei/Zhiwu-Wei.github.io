abstract: >-
  Mobile internet has become a fundamental modern infrastructure. We consider how access influences household wealth in the Philippines using a granular measure of local connectivity based on geocoded cell towers and identify causal impact through an instrument based on proximity to submarine cable landing points. Our results show that mobile internet connectivity increases household wealth, with effects across education levels and most pronounced in urban areas. We investigate mechanisms and demonstrate that improved connectivity stimulates activity in key economic sectors. Mobile internet enhances educational outcomes and promotes female labor force participation, though predominantly in occasional roles.
