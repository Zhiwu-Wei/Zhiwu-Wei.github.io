  Inequality is increasingly recognised as a driver of political protest in advanced economies, yet its role across the Global South remains poorly understood. In this paper, we study how localised wealth inequality fuels protest dynamics across more than 25,000 subnational administrative units in 88 Global South countries. We assemble novel, fine-grained estimates of relative wealth to construct measures of local wealth inequality, and link them to over 645,000 georeferenced protest events recorded daily from 2014 to 2018. Exploiting variation within subnational regions, we document a robust, positive association between local wealth inequality and protest incidence. This relationship is primarily driven by proximity to the wealthiest, while a strong middle class appears to buffer these effects. The strength of this association is moderated by national context: it is stronger in countries with lower levels of economic development, higher unemployment among individuals with advanced education, weaker regulatory quality and control of corruption, and greater social fractionalisation -- but also where the rule of law and protection of expression are stronger. For a subset of countries, we develop a new measure of `experienced inequality' -- capturing individuals' exposure to wealth disparities in their immediate surroundings -- and show that it is strongly correlated with protest activity, particularly when inequality is measured within smaller, more proximate areas. Our findings reveal that localised, experienced wealth inequality is a powerful but context specific predictor of political protest across the Global South.
